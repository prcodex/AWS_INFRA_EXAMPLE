## 🏗 Architecture Pattern

This guide demonstrates a **multi-service single-instance** architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   EC2 Instance (t3.2xlarge)        │
│   Ubuntu 22.04 LTS                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Port 8046: Service 1 (Main)       │
│  Port 8055: Service 2 (Standalone)  │
│  Port 8056: Service 3 (Orchestrator)│
│  Port 8057: Service 4 (Catalog)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
           │
           ↓
    Elastic IP (Static)
    Security Groups (Firewall)
           │
           ↓
     S3 Bucket (Backups)
```

---

## 📚 Use Cases

This infrastructure pattern is suitable for:

- AI/ML research platforms
- Multi-service web applications
- Data processing pipelines
- Internal tools and dashboards
- Development/staging environments
- Small-to-medium production workloads

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **AWS Free Tier**: This setup exceeds free tier limits (t3.2xlarge is not eligible)
2. **Costs**: Monitor your AWS billing dashboard regularly
3. **Security**: Always use strong passwords and MFA
4. **Backups**: Implement the backup strategies before production use
5. **Updates**: Keep Ubuntu and packages updated
